## Section 1:
You can start this section following *session 1*, but you may want to wait until you feel comfortable wtih basic SQL query writing. 

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Design a logical data model
- Duplicate the logical data model and add another table to it following the instructions
- Write, within this markdown file, an answer to Prompt 3


###  Design a Logical Model

#### Prompt 1
Design a logical model for a small bookstore. 📚

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. 

Additionally, include a date table. 

There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) or [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

**HINT:** You do not need to create any data for this prompt. This is a conceptual model only. 

Done. See diagram. 

#### Prompt 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

Done. See diagram. 

#### Prompt 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2? 

**HINT:** search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions. 

```
See my diagram. For customer_address_type_1, an entry gets re-written if the entry is updated. For customer_address_type_2, all customer addresses get a start date. If a customer moves, their previous entry gets an end date and a new entry is created with a new start date. 
```

## Section 2:
You can start this section following *session 4*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment2.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment2.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question


### Write SQL

#### COALESCE
1. Our favourite manager wants a detailed long list of products, but is afraid of tables! We tell them, no problem! We can produce a list with all of the appropriate details. 

Using the following syntax you create our super cool and not at all needy manager a list:
```
SELECT 
product_name || ', ' || product_size|| ' (' || product_qty_type || ')'
FROM product
```

But wait! The product table has some bad data (a few NULL values). 
Find the NULLs and then using COALESCE, replace the NULL with a blank for the first problem, and 'unit' for the second problem. 

**HINT**: keep the syntax the same, but edited the correct components with the string. The `||` values concatenate the columns into strings. Edit the appropriate columns -- you're making two edits -- and the NULL rows will be fixed. All the other rows will remain the same.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### Windowed Functions
1. Write a query that selects from the customer_purchases table and numbers each customer’s visits to the farmer’s market (labeling each market date with a different number). Each customer’s first visit is labeled 1, second visit is labeled 2, etc. 

You can either display all rows in the customer_purchases table, with the counter changing on each new market date for each customer, or select only the unique market dates per customer (without purchase details) and number those visits. 

**HINT**: One of these approaches uses ROW_NUMBER() and one uses DENSE_RANK().

2. Reverse the numbering of the query from a part so each customer’s most recent visit is labeled 1, then write another query that uses this one as a subquery (or temp table) and filters the results to only the customer’s most recent visit.

3. Using a COUNT() window function, include a value along with each row of the customer_purchases table that indicates how many different times that customer has purchased that product_id.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### String manipulations
1. Some product names in the product table have descriptions like "Jar" or "Organic". These are separated from the product name with a hyphen. Create a column using SUBSTR (and a couple of other commands) that captures these, but is otherwise NULL. Remove any trailing or leading whitespaces. Don't just use a case statement for each product! 

| product_name               | description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| Habanero Peppers - Organic | Organic     |

**HINT**: you might need to use INSTR(product_name,'-') to find the hyphens. INSTR will help split the column. 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### UNION
1. Using a UNION, write a query that displays the market dates with the highest and lowest total sales.

**HINT**: There are a possibly a few ways to do this query, but if you're struggling, try the following: 1) Create a CTE/Temp Table to find sales values grouped dates; 2) Create another CTE/Temp table with a rank windowed function on the previous query to create "best day" and "worst day"; 3) Query the second temp table twice, once for the best day, once for the worst day, with a UNION binding them.

## Section 3:
You can start this section following *session 5*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment2.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment2.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question

### Write SQL

#### Cross Join
1. Suppose every vendor in the `vendor_inventory` table had 5 of each of their products to sell to **every** customer on record. How much money would each vendor make per product? Show this by vendor_name and product name, rather than using the IDs.

**HINT**: Be sure you select only relevant columns and rows. Remember, CROSS JOIN will explode your table rows, so CROSS JOIN should likely be a subquery. Think a bit about the row counts: how many distinct vendors, product names are there (x)? How many customers are there (y). Before your final group by you should have the product of those two queries (x\*y). 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### INSERT
1. Create a new table "product_units". This table will contain only products where the `product_qty_type = 'unit'`. It should use all of the columns from the product table, as well as a new column for the `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.  Name the timestamp column `snapshot_timestamp`.

2. Using `INSERT`, add a new row to the product_unit table (with an updated timestamp). This can be any product you desire (e.g. add another record for Apple Pie). 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### DELETE 
1. Delete the older record for the whatever product you added.

**HINT**: If you don't specify a WHERE clause, [you are going to have a bad time](https://imgflip.com/i/8iq872).

<div align="center">-</div>

#### UPDATE
1. We want to add the current_quantity to the product_units table. First, add a new column, `current_quantity` to the table using the following syntax.
```
ALTER TABLE product_units
ADD current_quantity INT;
```

Then, using `UPDATE`, change the current_quantity equal to the **last** `quantity` value from the vendor_inventory details. 

**HINT**: This one is pretty hard. First, determine how to get the "last" quantity per product. Second, coalesce null values to 0 (if you don't have null values, figure out how to rearrange your query so you do.) Third, `SET current_quantity = (...your select statement...)`, remembering that WHERE can only accommodate one column. Finally, make sure you have a WHERE statement to update the right row, you'll need to use `product_units.product_id` to refer to the correct row within the product_units table. When you have all of these components, you can run the update statement.

### Ethics

Read: Boykis, V. (2019, October 16). _Neural nets are just people all the way down._ Normcore Tech. <br>
    https://vicki.substack.com/p/neural-nets-are-just-people-all-the

**What are the ethical issues important to this story?**

Consider, for example, concepts of labour, bias, LLM proliferation, moderating content, intersection of technology and society, ect. 


```
Another fascinating read. What comes immedietly to mind is the harvard implicit association test (https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html) which tests for one's implicit biases in certain topics (e.g. race, gender, class) by getting the player to sort images or words into categories very quickly. The hypothesis is that some associations are easier than others, which says something about the underlying bias one has. Since much of the work sorting/training images for ImageNet was manual, and probably very fast as suggested by the Mechanical Turk section, it is very easy for implicit biases to sneak into the underlying training. While this may not be so much of an ethical issue when it comes to deciding whether or not something is a hot dog (though the great "is it a hot dog or a sandwich?" debate rages on), it becomes more insidious when labeling things like poeple's faces, as alluded to near the end of the article. 

We don't always think of these biases when working with AI models, because we cannot see that there is an underlying human labor element underneath it all. In other words, we've removed the human from AI, and thus tend to view AI as a neutral entity. This is problematic because it can lead to a falsely inflated trust in these systems, viewing them as "above" human bias and judgement when the opposite is in fact true -- these systems are very prone to errors. This increased trust in AI leads also to a decreased trust in one's own judgement. I see this a lot in students who are relying more and more heavily on AI over their own judgement. It is this latter piece that is most important; yes, students will use AI because an easier solution is more tempting than putting in the work. But this is coming at a cost to them trusting themselves (interesting as many of these AI models are training on the judgement of a real human), which can in turn make them more susceptible to propaganda or false information, among other things. I think it is indeed an ethical issue that must be combated with more education on the underlying biases of AI as well as the fact that it is prone to errors.

This erasure of the underlying human labour/biases and treating AI as a neutral identity is particularly problematic in the medical field. Early studies in the medical field were mostly focused on Caucaisan males -- these models were not generalizable to women and other diverse populations. AI moved so fast that these models were already beginning to be pushed into use in the medical field (I am thinking particularly MRI imaging as this is my field), so at the most recent MRI conference I went to there was an urgent call for regulation of these models because this became an ethical issue. We would not be operating at the peak standard of care for women and other diverse populations. 

We also forget that AI models, such as chatgpt, do not simply exist in the intangible world of the internet. There are real world impacts to using AI, specifically energy expenditure. I've heard that every inquiry uses "a fishbowl's worth of water". I have seen people think that AI can solve issues of third world countries. However, at the MRI conference I went to, it was stated that AI is not a solution to these countries because why would they waste water resources on it when their people are already struggling with drinking water? It was something I had not considered, and I realized that this was because all the labour underneath that AI model was completely invisible to me. 
 
To summarize the above, the main ethical issues I see that were addressed in the article have their foundations primarily in underlying biases that are not visible which have wide-reaching effects, as well as the invisible labour and real-world impact that contributed to the creation and continues to contribute to the use of these models.
